# ESTIMATING-VALUE-AT-RISK-OF-A-PORTFOLIO-WITH-GARCH-FAMILY-MODELS-Time-Series-project
1.**Project Overview**

This project aims to estimate the Value at Risk (VaR) of a financial portfolio using GARCH family models. Value at Risk is a widely used risk measure in finance that quantifies the potential loss in value of a portfolio over a defined period for a given confidence interval. The GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) family models are used to capture the volatility clustering often observed in financial time series data.

2.**Introduction**

Value at Risk (VaR) is a key metric in financial risk management. It estimates the maximum potential loss of a portfolio within a given confidence level over a specific time horizon. This project utilizes GARCH models to estimate the VaR of a portfolio by modeling and forecasting the conditional volatility of returns.

3.**Data Description**

The project requires financial time series data, specifically historical prices of assets in the portfolio. The dataset should contain:
   
   1. **Date**: The trading dates.
   
   2. **Price**: The closing prices of the assets.
     
4.**Results**

The estimated VaR provides an insight into the potential maximum loss of the portfolio over the specified period at the given confidence level. The results can be visualized and interpreted to enhance risk management strategies.
